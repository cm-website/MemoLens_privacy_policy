    <h1>MemoLens Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p>Effective Date: March 19, 2025</p>

    <p>This Privacy Policy applies to the MemoLens app ("Application") created by Derek Sha ("Service Provider") as a free service. This service is provided "AS IS".</p>

    <h2>Information Collection and Use</h2>
    <p>The Application collects information to provide and improve our services. This includes:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Personal Information:</strong> Such as your email address and phone number, provided voluntarily for account creation or customer support.</li>
        <li><strong>Facial Recognition Data:</strong> Images uploaded by users are processed to extract facial feature data ("facial embeddings") for the purpose of tagging and organizing photos within the yearbook feature of the app. The raw images are not stored after processing.</li>
        <li><strong>Automatically Collected Information:</strong> Including device IP address, operating system, pages visited within the Application, and time spent on those pages.</li>
        <li><strong>Location Data:</strong> The Application collects your device's approximate geographical location to provide personalized content and location-based services. This data is also used for analytics to improve the Application's performance.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Use of Information</h2>
    <p>The collected information is used to:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Provide, maintain, and improve the Application's features and services.</li>
        <li>Personalize user experience based on location and usage patterns.</li>
        <li>Communicate with users regarding updates, promotions, and important notices.</li>
        <li>Ensure security and prevent fraudulent activities.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Facial Recognition Data Policy</h2>
    <p>We take your privacy seriously, especially concerning sensitive data like facial recognition information:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Data Collection:</strong> Facial feature data is extracted from user-uploaded images to facilitate the automatic tagging and organization of photos within the yearbook feature.</li>
        <li><strong>Data Storage:</strong> MemoLens does not store raw facial images. Instead, it extracts vector embeddings from user-uploaded images, which are securely stored using encryption on AWS cloud servers. The raw images are automatically deleted after processing.</li>
        <li><strong>Data Sharing:</strong> We do not share facial recognition data with third parties. All processing occurs within the Application's secure environment.</li>
        <li><strong>Data Retention:</strong> Facial embeddings are retained as long as the user maintains an account. Users can delete their facial data at any time through the Application's settings, resulting in permanent removal from our servers.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Third-Party Access</h2>
    <p>We utilize third-party services to enhance the Application's functionality. These services may collect information used to identify you. Links to the privacy policies of third-party service providers used by the Application:</p>
